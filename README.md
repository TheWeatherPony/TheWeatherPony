- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheWeatherPony
- 👀 I’m interested in backend/algorithms as well as game development, though I shy away from graphics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, my... (10th?) language
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computer games, and am open to professional hiring for established companies (including outside the gaming industry)
- 📫 I can be reached at weatherpony@gmail.com for Minecraft or modding things and davfrs@gmail.com for non-Minecraft nor modding things. 
- I know code, but not tools. I'm not opposed to learning tools, they just aren't my codebase. This... includes Git. \*points to the multiple repos for PML, my generic Oracle-Java AOP modding platform\*

:woozy_face: Please understand that I sometimes have small, temporary bouts of code insanity when I hit a brick wall from working with complicated and completely undocumented code when it leaves me with a chained XY problem. (last one was caused by 6+ year old, barely-reported (but was known) bugs *deep* in the JVM)
